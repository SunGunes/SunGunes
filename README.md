# About Me

I began my developer journey while at High School by enrolling pre-AP Computer Science course in September 2016. After that course, I had a solid passion for being a Full-Time Computer Scientist. I was the head of our [Hisar School's](https://www.hisarschool.k12.tr/hisar-okullari-en/) [Robotic Team](https://www.instagram.com/hisarravens/?hl=en) [Hisar Ravens](https://twitter.com/hisar_ravens). I gained so many skills such as dedication to an idea, being a team worker, working with a different group of people, and, most importantly, being a good leader. I picked up my knowledge of Java, C++, Matlab for coding the robots we build. After that, I wanted to make applications and get into App Desing/Development World. After completing Apple's and Udemy's App Development certifications. I created a few apps such as Todo Lists for Robotic Teams and GPA Calculator for our High School students.

When I got into the **[University Of Surrey for Computer Science BS](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/)** in September 2019, I put in my mind that I wanted to be a Full-Stack Web Developer and Blockchain Developer. The course combines practical projects and theoretical study, developing technical and transferable skills in:
- Web Development Languages: HTML5,CSS3,JavaScript,XML,JQuery,Ruby, Ajax
- Programming Languages: Java, Python, Haskell, C++
- Numerical computing Environments: Matlab, Scilab and Sage Math
