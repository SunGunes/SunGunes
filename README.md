# About Me

I began my developer journey while I was at High School with enroling ***pre-AP** Computer Science* course in September 2016. After that course I had an solid passion to be a Full-Time **Computer Scientiest**. I was the head of our [Hisar School's](https://www.hisarschool.k12.tr/hisar-okullari-en/) [Robotic Team](https://www.instagram.com/hisarravens/?hl=en) [Hisar Ravens](https://twitter.com/hisar_ravens). I gained so many skills such as dedication to an idea, being a teamworker and work with different group of people and most importantly being a good leader. I picked up my knowledge of *Java*, *C++*, *Matlab* for coding the robots we build. After that I wanted to build applications and get in to App Desing/Development World. After completeting Apple's and Udemy's App Developmenent certifications. I created few apps such as Todo Lists for Robotic Teams and GPA Calculator for our High School students.  

 When I got into the University Of Surrey for Computer Science BS, I put my mind that I want to be a Full-Stack Web Developer and BlockChain Developer. The course combines practical projects and theoretical study, developing technical and transferable skills in:
- Web Development Languages: HTML5,CSS3,JavaScript,XML,JQuery,Ruby, Ajax
- Programming Languages: Java, Python, Haskell, C++
- Numerical computing Environments: Matlab, Scilab and Sage Math
